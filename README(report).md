# TTSD-SKY
Assessment 2

We developed an applicaion where text converts into speech. We have used Google API TTS(Text To Speech).
In our application we provided a text box so that user can enter input text which he wants to listen and a button to trigger a request to the rest service api.

Intructions:

Run the application using XCode.
Enter the text which you want to listen into the text box 
And click on "Speak On" button. 
Now you will be able to listen the text you have typed. Enjoy the app :)
