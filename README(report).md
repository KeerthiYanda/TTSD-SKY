Assessment 2

    We developed an application where text converts into speech. We have used Google API TTS (Text To Speech). In our application we provided a text box so that user can enter input text, which he wants to listen, and a button to trigger a request to the rest service API.

It is part of our project:
--------------------------
    Our project is University Guider, in which the robot stops at each campus location and speaks about the location. The second major part of the project is to make robot speak. So we used Google TTS API to convert input text to speech.
